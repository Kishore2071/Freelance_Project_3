        <span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#4c99e6;"><strong>You are eligible for an HSA if you are enrolling in the Cigna Core Plan.</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        A Health Savings Account (<strong>HSA</strong>) is available to employees enrolled in a High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). An HSA allows employees to set aside pre-tax money to pay for eligible medical and prescription drug expenses. If you don't need to use the funds immediately, you can maintain your account for years to come.
    </p>
    <p>
        The HSA is owned by you. Unused funds accumulate over time and roll over from year to year; there are no "use-it-or-lose-it" rules. Since the HSA is your account, you keep the money if you choose a new health plan, when you retire, or if you leave.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that participation in the HSA Plan excludes you from participating in the general-purpose Health Care Flexible Spending Account Plan (FSA). You may participate in the Limited-Purpose Health Care FSA which covers eligible dental and vision expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
        To enroll, please designate an election amount. The IRS maximum annual contribution amounts are as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style="color:#4ce64c;"><strong>√ &nbsp;</strong></span>Individual: $4,150 : Abt Associates Contributes $500 towards this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br>
        <span style="color:#4ce64c;"><strong>√</strong></span> Family: $8,300 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: &nbsp;Abt Associates Contributes $1000 towards this.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style="color:#4c99e6;"><strong>If you are 55+ you are eligible to make an HSA catch-up contribution of up to $1,000 per year.</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
